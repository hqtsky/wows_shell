# ShellCPP
Cpp header only library for calculating shell performance in World of Warships
## Compatibility
Should be compatible with most platforms - though code is written to take advantage of multithreading and vectorization
## Current Functionality:
Calculate [For Various Distances]: 
### At Impact
angle of impact, impact velocity, raw belt/deck penetration, penetration adjusted for angle of impact
### Post-Penetration
shell detonation distances - some assumptiongs were made with regards to normalization changing shell direction
## Extensions
Python
WebAssembly - used in https://jcw780.github.io/overpen_calculator/
